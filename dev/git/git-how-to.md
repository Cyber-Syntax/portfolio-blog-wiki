## How to get updates from main repo without losing your commits

GitHub Copilot: If you want to get the latest commit from the original repository while keeping your changes, you can use `git pull`​ with the `--rebase`​ option. Here are the steps:

1. First, make sure you are on the branch where you want to apply the updates:

```git
git checkout <your_branch>
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git diff origin/<your_branch>
# resolve conflict
git add <file_with_resolved_conflict
git rebase --continue
git push origin <your_branch> --force
```

## How to keep README, LICENSE

> [!INFO] files from deleted when merging new branch to main.

1. First, switch to the branch that you want to merge into `main`​:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
2. Then, use the `checkout`​ command to get the `README`​ and `LICENSE`​ files from `main`​:
   - This add README and LICENSE files to your bare-repo that you want to merge into main.
   ```bash
   git checkout main -- README LICENSE
   ```
3. If there are any conflicts, resolve them. Then, commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Merged branch and kept README and LICENSE files'
   ```
4. Finally, switch back to the `main`​ branch and merge the other branch:
   `bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
`
   This way, the `README`​ and `LICENSE`​ files from `main`​ will be kept even after merging the other branch [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/449541/how-can-i-selectively-merge-or-pick-changes-from-another-branch-in-git), [Source 1](https://pipinghot.dev/tutorial/merge-specific-files-from-git-branch/), [Source 3](https://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2009/02/25/git-tip-how-to-merge-specific-files-from-another-branch/).
   Another way to handle this situation is to use Git attributes. You can define a merge driver that always favors the current version of a file, and then use this driver for the files that you want to preserve. Here's how you can do it:

5. Define a merge driver that always favors the current version of a file:
   ```bash
   git git-bare --global merge.ours.driver true
   ```
6. Add a `.gitattributes`​ file that tells Git to use the `ours`​ driver for the `README`​ and `LICENSE`​ files:
   `bash
echo 'README merge=ours' >> .gitattributes
echo 'LICENSE merge=ours' >> .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m 'chore: Preserve README and LICENSE files during merges'
`
   This will tell Git to use the `ours`​ driver (which always favors the current version of a file) when merging the `README`​ and `LICENSE`​ files [Source 2](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/how-to-make-git-preserve-specific-files-while-merging-18c92343826b).

## How to clone specific branch?

```
git clone -b bare-repo <url>
```

## How to update(commit, push, merge) github projects?

```bash
# Update dev or enhancement branch
git status #to see modifications
git commit -am 'updated <file_name>'
git push origin <branch_name>(e.g enhancement or dev)

# Merge changes to main
git checkout main
git merge enhancement
git push origin main
```

## Revert last commit

```git
git revert HEAD
```

```git
 git revert --no-commit da65336                                                                                                                                         ─╯

 ~/Documents/repository/super-productivity on master revert +1
 git commit
```

## How to sync fork via upstream for new commits?

> Source: [github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

```python
git checkout master
# Get commits
git fetch upstream
# Rebase local branch to insert last commits from fetched upstream
git rebase upstream/master
# Push to your fork
git push origin master
```

## How solve 2 commit behind or sync to branch with main after main get updated from PR?

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch origin main
git checkout feat/extract
git rebase origin/main
```

## How to squash N commits to 1 commit?

> [!INFO] More Resource: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-commits/

```python
# Commits = 26
git rebase -i HEAD~26
```

- After that select the commit you want to make first commit with `pick` , make others `squash` or `s`
- If you want to make 2 commit from 26 commit use `b` called `break` between 2 commit. After first commit done with rebase, `git rebase --continue` to handle second commit.

```python
pick adaafa495 fix: settings section
s 49b1b4caa fix: delete unused string
s 8a34a3df0 fix: update changed GITHUB FORM string
s 7ba585e69 fix: delete unused strings

```

- update commit message for first commit e.g `fix!: delete unused strings`
- `git rebase --continue`
- update commit message e.g `feat!: add missing strings`
- `git push origin turkish --force`

## How to sync and solve commit behind

> [!INFO] how to fix 3 commit behind, 9 commit ahead.
> How to PR your commits to repo when your branch behind from some commits without losing your commits?

- Fetch updates to local from upstream, push updates to origin forked master branch, Rebase master to branch you want to add new updates from master and push force your branch

```python
# sync upstream master and push new commits to your fork
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin master

# get latest updates from master and add your branch
git rebase master
git push origin turkish-update --force
```

## How to revert back without commit?

> [!INFO] Bununla commit hiç bir şekilde görünmez ve eklenen commit tamamen yok olur. Dikkatli ol.
> How to undo commits, revert back without commit to github like delete commit?

```python
# son commit resetle
git reset --hard HEAD~1
# OUTPUT: HEAD is now at b8492fdd3 Fix SCHEDULE string and add new strings
# push to your branch with force to not deal with conflict errors
git push origin turkish-fix --force
```

## How to solve 169 commit ahead from upstream?

- This error going to show something like this `  ~/Doc/r/super-productivity on  @59f0afad rebase-i 6/164 ~1 `. This is represent 164 commit conflict and git want it user to solve it.
- Abort this if your commit not necessary `git rebase --abort` and reset git and push changes to your forked master branch via force.

```python
git reset --hard upstream/master
# Then it's going to show 169 commits is going to unstaged or revert via arrow down:
#─   ~/Doc/r/super-productivity on   master ⇣169
# After that force changes to fork.
git push origin master --force
```

- Change the current working directory to your local project.
- Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to `BRANCHNAME`​​ will be stored in the local branch `upstream/BRANCHNAME`​​.
  ```shell
  $ git fetch upstream
  > remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
  > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
  > remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
  > Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
  > From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY
  >  * [new branch]      main     -> upstream/main
  ```
- Check out your fork's local default branch - in this case, we use `main`​​. It can be `master`​​ too
  ```shell
  $ git checkout main
  > Switched to branch 'main'
  ```
- Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - in this case, `upstream/main`​​ - into your local default branch. This brings your fork's default branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.
  ```shell
  $ git merge upstream/main
  > Updating a422352..5fdff0f
  > Fast-forward
  >  README                    |    9 -------
  >  README.md                 |    7 ++++++
  >  2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
  >  delete mode 100644 README
  >  create mode 100644 README.md
  ```
  If your local branch didn't have any unique commits, Git will perform a fast-forward. For more information, see [Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) in the Git documentation.
  ```shell
  $ git merge upstream/main
  > Updating 34e91da..16c56ad
  > Fast-forward
  >  README.md                 |    5 +++--
  >  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
  ```
  If your local branch had unique commits, you may need to resolve conflicts. For more information, see "[Addressing merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts)."
- Also if master has commit, you need to push to changes to your fork master
  ```git
  git push origin master
  ```
